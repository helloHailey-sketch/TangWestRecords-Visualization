## Introduction

This project visualizes Xuanzang's westward journey as recorded in the *Great Tang Records on the Western Regions* and the *Biography of the Tripitaka Master of the Great Ci'en Monastery*. It combines map-based visualization and distant reading techniques to present route, time, location, and cultural information along the journey. The system highlights both explicit attributes (such as geographic positions and place names) and implicit attributes (like textual content, religion, and climate), enabling users to explore historical context interactively. Additionally, a timeline and navigation sidebar allow users to follow the sequence of travel, while text-based visual summaries support structural and comparative analysis.
